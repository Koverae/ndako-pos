# Ndako POS

## Overview

Ndako POS is a modern, feature-rich Point of Sale (POS) module designed for the restaurant and bar operations within the Ndako Hotel Management System. Built using Laravel and Livewire, Ndako POS delivers a seamless, responsive, and intuitive user experience tailored for hospitality businesses. Inspired by the Odoo POS module, Ndako POS combines robust functionality with offline capabilities, seamless integration with hotel bookings, and AI-driven enhancements to optimize operations—all while prioritizing cost efficiency by leveraging open-source and free tools.

## Purpose

Ndako POS aims to streamline restaurant and bar transactions, enhance staff efficiency, and improve guest satisfaction. It supports real-time order processing, inventory management, and booking integration, with offline functionality to ensure uninterrupted service during network downtimes. The module is designed to be scalable, user-friendly, and customizable to meet the needs of small to medium-sized hospitality businesses.

Key Features

### 1. Core POS Functionality

- Order Management: Create, modify, and cancel orders with an intuitive interface. Supports split bills, discounts, and custom notes.

- Product Catalog: Manage menus with categories (e.g., Food, Beverages, Specials) and variants (e.g., sizes, add-ons). Includes images and descriptions for quick identification.

- Payment Processing: Supports multiple payment methods (cash, card, mobile payments) with partial and full payment options.

- Table Management: Interactive floor plan for assigning orders to tables, merging tables, or transferring orders.

- Multi-User Support: Role-based access for cashiers, servers, and managers with secure login and session tracking.

### 2. Offline Capabilities

- Local Storage: Utilizes browser-based IndexedDB to store transactions and product data locally, ensuring uninterrupted operations during network outages.

- Sync Mechanism: Automatically syncs offline transactions with the server once connectivity is restored, with conflict resolution to prevent data loss.

- Lightweight Data Model: Optimized database queries and caching to minimize data transfer and ensure performance in low-bandwidth environments.

### 3. Integration with Ndako Hotel Management System

- Booking Integration: Attach restaurant/bar orders to guest bookings for seamless billing. Supports room charges and automatic updates to booking folios.

- Guest Profiles: Access guest information (e.g., preferences, allergies) from the Ndako system to personalize service.

- Centralized Reporting: Unified reporting across POS and hotel operations for revenue, occupancy, and performance analytics.

### 4. AI-Driven Enhancements

To enhance functionality without incurring costs, Ndako POS integrates open-source or free AI tools:

- Menu Recommendations: Uses a lightweight, locally-hosted recommendation engine (e.g., based on TensorFlow.js or a custom collaborative filtering algorithm) to suggest items based on order history and popular combinations.

- Inventory Forecasting: Implements a simple time-series forecasting model (e.g., using Prophet or a custom Python script running on the server) to predict stock needs based on historical sales data.

- Sentiment Analysis for Feedback: Analyzes customer feedback (entered manually or via digital receipts) using open-source NLP libraries like spaCy or Hugging Face’s Transformers (free models) to gauge satisfaction and flag issues.

#### AI Implementation Notes:

All AI models are hosted locally on the Laravel server or run client-side (e.g., TensorFlow.js in the browser) to avoid cloud service costs.

Pre-trained models are fine-tuned with restaurant-specific data (e.g., menu items, sales history) during setup.

Minimal computational requirements ensure compatibility with standard server hardware.

### 5. User Interface and Experience

- Responsive Design: Built with Livewire for a dynamic, SPA-like experience without page reloads. Optimized for desktops, tablets, and touch-screen devices.

- Modern Aesthetics: Clean, minimalistic UI inspired by Odoo POS, with customizable themes to match brand identity.

- Fast Navigation: Keyboard shortcuts and touch-friendly controls for quick order entry and processing.

### 6. Inventory and Reporting

- Real-Time Inventory: Tracks stock levels for ingredients and menu items, with alerts for low stock.

- Sales Analytics: Detailed reports on sales, top-selling items, and staff performance, exportable to CSV or PDF.

- Audit Trail: Logs all transactions and user actions for accountability and troubleshooting.

### 7. Security and Compliance

- Data Encryption: End-to-end encryption for sensitive data (e.g., payment details, guest information) using Laravel’s built-in security features.

- Role-Based Access Control: Restricts access to sensitive features (e.g., voids, refunds) based on user roles.

- GDPR Compliance: Configurable data retention policies to comply with privacy regulations.

## Technical Architecture

Backend: Laravel (PHP) handles API endpoints, business logic, and database interactions. Uses Eloquent ORM for efficient data modeling.

Frontend: Livewire for real-time, reactive UI components, reducing the need for separate JavaScript frameworks. Tailwind CSS for styling.

Database: MySQL or SQLite (for smaller deployments), with optimized schemas for menu items, orders, and inventory.

Offline Support: Service Workers and IndexedDB for client-side data storage and caching.

AI Integration: TensorFlow.js for client-side recommendations; server-side Python scripts (via Laravel’s task scheduler) for forecasting and NLP tasks.

Deployment: Supports cloud or on-premises deployment, with Docker compatibility for easy scaling.

## Comparison to Odoo POS

Ndako POS is designed to match or exceed Odoo POS in key areas:

Offline Mode: Like Odoo, Ndako POS operates seamlessly offline, but with a more robust sync mechanism tailored for hospitality.

Integration: Tighter integration with hotel bookings compared to Odoo’s generic POS approach.

Cost: Ndako POS avoids subscription costs by leveraging open-source tools, unlike Odoo’s paid plans for advanced features.



Customization: Laravel and Livewire allow for greater flexibility in tailoring the UI and workflows to specific business needs.
